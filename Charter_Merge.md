# Agent Communication Protocols (acp) Proposed Charter

## Introduction

The Agent Communication Protocols (acp) Working Group will work on defining protocol building blocks for enabling interoperability for AI Agent applications across the Internet or intranet. An AI agent is an autonomous, adaptive intelligent software system that uses AI models to complete a specific objective on behalf of a human user or another AI agent. To complete such objectives, it makes decisions, executes actions, and interacts with other agents through tasks and tools. Unlike traditional software workloads that follow fixed execution paths, an AI Agent dynamically determines at run time which actions to take, which tools to invoke, and which agents to collaborate with, based on reasoning over its goals and context. AI Agents often interact with users via chat or voice, performing tasks based on the flow of conversation.

With the expansion of communication over the Internet between AI Agents and external resources (tools, other AI Agents), communication reliability across platforms and vendors becomes increasingly important. The role of the acp working group is to facilitate such interoperability so that tools and agents can be provided by multiple vendors.

## Key Considerations

Several considerations arise which are unique to AI Agent protocols and are a focus of activity for protocol development:

* AI Agents act as autonomous software entities that need to be authenticated independently of the users they represent. Establishing verifiable agent identity that is distinct from user identity is a prerequisite for meaningful authorization and accountability.

* AI Agents also possess unique and differentiated skills that play a significant role in supporting collaborative tasks, which brings new considerations for how these specialized capabilities can be leveraged to select AI agents, initiate communication, and facilitate cross-domain interactions even within enterprise intranets and on the Internet.

* Interactions of AI Agents with other AI Agents and tools can be long-lived, make use of the exchange of significant amounts of context across various modes of communication (such as text, audio, and video interactions), and may require very low latency. This introduces new considerations around reliability, transport session management, and data transport, including the concurrent exchange of real-time data (such as voice and video), semi-real-time data (such as chat), and non-real-time data (such as tool call inputs and outputs).

* To protect data exchanged between AI Agents (and between AI Agents and tools) over potentially untrusted networks, particularly when handling sensitive information (such as personal data or conversational context), mechanisms are required to establish and verify identity, ensure confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, selective disclosure, and delegated authorization across AI Agent chains. This introduces new considerations around protocol-level security and privacy mechanisms.

## Scope

The scope of the working group is agent-to-agent and agent-to-tool communication protocols. The working group will document common use cases to derive requirements for the protocol building blocks.

The working group will define the framework for agent-to-agent and agent-to-tool interactions, describe the associated protocol suite, and outline the framework's functional blocks, their relationships, and mechanisms for structured, semi-structured, and multi-modal information exchange to support collaborative tasks across domains.

The working group will consider existing de facto agent communication protocols and frameworks (such as the A2A protocol and MCP protocols specified under the auspices of the Linux Foundation) as a basis for its work.

## Out of Scope

The following topics are explicitly out of scope for this working group:

* Definition of AI models, agent reasoning algorithms, tool-specific business logic, or AI agent result validation.
* Standardization of agent behavior, decision-making, or planning semantics.
* AI agent behavioral security (e.g., preventing the AI model itself from hallucinating).

## Deliverables

The working group will produce the following deliverables:

### (1) Use Cases, Gap Analysis, and Requirements (Informational)

Foundational work will be documented through a set of informational Internet-Drafts covering:

* **Use cases** focused on Agent-to-agent and Agent-to-tool communications, used to verify the suitability of the protocols developed.
* **Gap analysis and requirements** based on examination of existing de facto protocols implemented in open-source projects, from which necessary protocol requirements are derived.

### (2) AI Agent Protocol Framework (Standards Track)

A standards-track framework document identifying key building blocks and detailing the protocol suite for interoperable Agent-to-agent and Agent-to-tool communications. This document serves as an architectural overview and identifies areas for subsequent protocol specification work.

The framework will:

* Enable AI Agents to select and collaborate with other AI Agents on the Internet or intranet, deployed in various interconnected domains and ecosystems, to execute simple or complex tasks.
* Allow multi-modal collaboration using varied data formats such as text, images, video, audio, and structured data with exchange of multi-modal contexts.
* Describe the functional blocks, their relationships, and the mechanisms for structured, semi-structured, and multi-modal information exchange to support collaborative tasks across domains.
* Identify the protocol suite covering session management, transport, security, and identity building blocks.

### (3) AI Agent Session Protocol (Standards Track)

A standards-track protocol for the creation and maintenance of long-lived sessions between AI agents, or between AI agents and tools. These sessions allow for the bidirectional exchange of data, including model context, tool call results, and messages.

The session protocol will:

* Provide timed (short or long-lived) session management, enabling the establishment, update, context handling, and termination of the services of interacting agents and tools.
* Facilitate highly scalable and reliable session management, capable of surviving network and server failures while supporting graceful recovery.
* Support concurrent exchange of real-time data (such as voice and video), semi-real-time data (such as chat), and non-real-time data (such as tool call inputs and outputs).
* Be a foundational building block on top of which additional protocols can be built, with appropriate layering and extension points enabling its adoption by other application-layer protocols, including existing de facto agent communication protocols such as MCP and A2A.
* Be based on modern IETF application transfer protocols, such as QUIC, WebTransport or MoQ, based on the use cases.


## Coordination

This working group is expected to closely coordinate with other related IETF working groups:

* **Security:** Web Authorization Protocol (OAuth), webbotauth, WIMSE — on identity, authorization, and security considerations.
* **Transport:** WebTransport, MoQ, QUIC, TSVWG — on data transport and session management.
* **Discovery and Operations:** INT area, OPS area — on agent discovery and operational considerations.

If the working group needs any changes to or extensions of protocols specified by other working groups, those issues will be raised with the relevant working groups for decisions on how best to handle them. The group is also expected to maintain close communication with open-source projects running under the Linux Foundation.
